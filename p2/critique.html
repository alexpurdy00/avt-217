	<h1>Five Guys</h1>
	<img src="img/fiveguys.png" alt="Five Guys">
<p>This webpage is my favorite by far. It is very clean and consise, keeping to the point. Additionally, it is very tileable, every section being completely self contained. The pages are short, knowing what they're doing and not carying on.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Chipotle</h1>
	<img src="img/chipotle.png" alt="Chipotle">
	<p>This website is clean. It know what it is doing, and makes sure to keep their food right in front of you. But, in doing that, the webpage comes off as crowded. On top of that, for some reason, something I dont really like about this page is how long it is. It seemed like it just kept going, nd that ade me feel lost in it.</p>
	<br>
<h1>Pizza Hut</h1>
	<img src="img/pizzahut.png" alt="Pizza Hut">
	<p>Pizza Hut made their website incredebly small. Not the webpage size, but the website itself. Usually, most websites have a nav bar that pushes people to order or cater from them. Pizza Hut just has 9-12 tiles that show off their deals. Pa tthat, the website has no personaity to it. The background is white, along with 90% of the tiles.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>McDonalds</h1>
	<img src="img/mcdonalds.png" alt="McDonalds">
	<p>McDonald's website is quite bland. More inviting than Pizza Hut's, but not by much. It has a very corperate feel to it, which I understand is their current branding effort, but it makes them feel impersonal to me. Nothing about it makes me want to interact with the site at all.</p>
	<br>
<h1>Taco Bell</h1>
<img src="img/tacobell.png" alt="Taco Bell">
<p>Taco Bell's website, like McDOnalds, seems very corperate at first. But as you look around, you can tell that it isn't as sleek as it seems. It doesh have that Taco Bell brand of slighty off colors, not qute meshing with the page. And I like that. It makes the brand feel more 'human' in a way.</p>

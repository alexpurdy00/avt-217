	<h1>Good vs. Bad Websites</h1>
	
	<h2>Good</h2>
	<h3>Website 1: <a href="http://consider.co/">consider.co</a></h3>
	<a href="http://consider.co"><img src="img/consider.png" alt="consider.com" width="50%"></a>
    <p>This website know what it wants to be. It is clearly divided into sections, each focused on one topic. The flow is assisted by a floating ‘topic,’ which follows you down it’s section and tags off with the next section. The color scheme is clear, with each color being committed to a section, and never overlapping. The text is concise, the sections clear on what they are, and every element is necessary.</p>

	<h3>Website 2: <a href="http://encry.com">encry.com</a></h3>
	<a href="http://encry.com"><img src="img/encry.png" alt="http://encry.com" width="50%"></a>
    <p>Encry is a modern tech company, and it shows. Their website is ultra modern, with clear divides between sections and data. The color scheme is clear, and makes sure you know when they’re moving on from one idea to the next. They make sure that the text they use is short and descriptive, without being obtuse. Everything is obviously on the website for a reason, and everything is updated.</p> 

	
	<h2>Bad</h2>
	<h3>Website 1: <a href="http://roverp6cars.com">roverp6cars.com</a></h3>
	<a href="http://roverp6cars.com"><img src="img/roverp6cars.png" alt="roverp6cars.com" width="50%"></a>
    <p>This website is just terrible. It is cluttered, with elements just slapped on with no rhyme or reason. There is no cohesive color scheme, with the background being a drab grey with ugly red text just slapped on top of images. Almost every element is a link, which leads you down the rabbit hole of ugly pages. It’s like you asked a blind kid to make a webpage.</p>
	
	<h3>Website 2: <a href="http://art.yale.edu">art.yale.edu</a></h3>
	<a href="http://art.yale.edu"><img src="img/art.yale.png" alt="art.yale.com" width="50%"></a>
    <p>You’d expect more out of Yale, much less their art school. But apparently none of them can make a website for their life. The background is a photo of a whale and a seal repeated for the entire height of the page. Each link sends you to a page that is somehow more basic and more ugly with each link. There is no cohesive theme, other than degrading Yale in my mind. Apparently it’s on purpose, which is somehow worse.</p>
